# \<sliding-pages\>

[DEMO](https://alex-saunders.github.io/sliding-pages/components/sliding-pages/demo/)

`<sliding-pages>` is a simple carousel style element for moving between pages. The transitions are based on native app transitions and are implemented using the [FLIP](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/) animation technique for optimal performance. Page transitions can be actived by either swiping left or right or by chaing the `active-index` property.

## Usage

`sliding-pages` looks for and defines pages as immediate div children and forms an array using these, which the property `active-index` is based on. Nested children of these divs will be ignored.
The following HTML implements the `<sliding-pages>` element:

```html
<sliding-pages active-index="1">
  <div>
    <h1>
      Page 1
    </h1>
    <div>
      Child div
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>
      Page 2
    </h1>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>
      Page 3
    </h1>
  </div>
</sliding-pages>
```

With the corresponding JS:

```html
<script>
const pages = document.querySelector('sliding-pages');

function prevPage() {
  const currIndex = parseInt(pages.getAttribute('active-index'));
  pages.setAttribute('active-index', (currIndex - 1));
}
function nextPage() {
  const currIndex = parseInt(pages.getAttribute('active-index'));
  pages.setAttribute('active-index', (currIndex + 1))
}
</script>
```

## API Reference
### Properties

| Property          | Type     | Description                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |          
| **active-index**  | *Number* | The index of the current active page (*note, this is 0-based)*  |

### Methods

`<sliding-pages>` has no public methods as it's behaviour is purely defined by the `active-index` property. I.e. to go to the next page, increment active-index and to go to the previous page, decrement. This property is both observed and reflects to attribute i.e. one can manually change the active-index property to trigger a page change or if the page is swiped left or right, the active-index property will update to display this.
